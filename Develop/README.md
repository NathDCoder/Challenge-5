# Challenge-5
Challenge 5 Attempt
--------------------------------
1. I was able to successfully complete this challenge. 
The first step I took was to download momentJS and store the JSON in a seperate .js file. Then I worked on setting up the Html by giving each time slot a div classes and id's in order for JS to manipulate.

2. After setting up the html and Moment JS, I researched how to use momentJS with JS. After rewriting the code a few times I was able to write a successful if statement for the conditions of color according to what time it was. However it took me a while to find a way to manipulate the text area in order to display it. I left that code for a moment to focus on local storage and was advised to use the (this) method to target the parent and sibling elements, and (.attr) to target the id's in order to to make th code simpler and easier to understand.

3. After successfully establishing local storage I went back to the color conditions and used the (.each) function to loop through each id and the (this)method to target the id's easier as well.

4. The last thing I did was call the function and then make a .val() with parameters for local storage to save whatever's written in text area for each text area.ls
